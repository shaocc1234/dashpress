        DashPress has two default roles which are not editable or deletable and
        they are <code>Creator</code> and <code>Viewer</code>.
      </p>

      <h4> Creator</h4>
      <p>
        This is the can-do-all things role, which is the role the users
        installing the application get assigned. We basically skip any
        permission checks when a user has this role.
      </p>

      <h4>Viewer</h4>
      <p>
        This role has only <code>Can Manage All Entities</code> which means the
        user can only view and manage all enabled data but can&apos;t perform
        other app actions like configuring the app, managing users, managing
        roles, resetting passwords, etc.
      </p>

      <h4>Custom roles</h4>
      <p>
        You can create as many roles as you want and assign any permissions to
        them.
      </p>

      <InfoAlert message="When a custom role is deleted then all the users belonging to that role will be assigned the Viewer role" />
