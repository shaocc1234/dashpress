        This setting helps you manage how this entity will be presented on other
        tables when referenced, and also how you can organize the related
        entities on the details view.
      </p>
      <h4> Reference Template</h4>
      <p>
        When entities are referenced, the app tries to show the best two fields
        it thinks are best to present and sometimes it doesn&apos;t get it quite
        right or maybe it needs improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, when a table references the <code>Users</code> table, the
        app might select the <code>Username</code> and <code>Firstname</code> as
        the reference template. So if you want it to be the combination of the{" "}
        <code>Firstname</code> and <code>Lastname </code>
        instead, you can set that in this form with
        <RenderCode input="{{ first_name }} {{ last_name }}" />
        and the users will start showing in this format.
      </p>

      <p>
        This form uses Handlebars so any valid Handlebars format will work.
        Below are some valid templates
        <RenderCode
          input={`{{ title }} {{ first_name }} {{ last_name }}
/* Will render "Mr John Doe" */

{{ first_name }} - {{ last_name }}
/* Will render "John - Doe" */`}
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        When editing reference templates, The fields will be validated so as to
        eliminate typos, for example <code>{"{{ ffirst_namee }}"}</code> will
        give an error until corrected, in the same manner, fields that
        don&apos;t exist on that entity will give you errors.
      </p>

      <h4> Labels</h4>
      <p>
        Say you go to a post details, and the author entity is showing as{" "}
        <code>User</code> because that is the entity name. But if you would
        rather it be labeled a more contextual title like <code>Author</code>,
        you can simply do that here by filling in the desired name at entity
        input and this name will only appear under this entity relation list.
      </p>

      <h4> Selection</h4>
      <p>
        Say you have 15 related entities say for <code>Users</code> and you
        don&apos;t want all the 15 entities to be on the relations list when you
        view a user detail, Then you can simply toggle off the entities you
        don&apos;t want to show on the user&apos;s details and they will no
        longer appear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keep in mind that all disabled entities on the app will not show up on
        this list.
      </p>

      <h4> Order</h4>
      <p>
        Order the related entities how you want them to appear on the relations
        list.
      </p>
